# Abalone-Age-Prediction

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately estimates the age of abalones based on various physical measurements. This is achieved through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training machine learning models.

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.
